I really appreciated this article as someone particularly interested in interaction design. In my own experience in physical computing, working with sensors, prototyping etc., much of the cheap and accessible technology for physical interactions feels quite artificial. I really like the idea of someone creating a easily reproducible intelligent physical computing system using this 'smart 3D printing' technology. 

Thanks for sharing!
